JWT attack can be verified by following methods.

1. Exploiting flawed JWT signature verification

2.Accepting arbitrary signatures

3.Accepting tokens with no signature 

If the "algo" parameter is set "none", In case server is rejecting so filters can be bypassed using mixed of upper or lower case char.

4.bruteforcing the secretkeys.
wordlists of well known secret keys: https://github.com/wallarm/jwt-secrets/blob/master/jwt.secrets.list

using hashcat to bruteforce the secret: hashcat -a 0 -m 16500 <YOUR-JWT> /path/to/jwt.secrets.list 

5.JWT header parameter injections :
misconfigured servers sometimes use any key that's embedded in the jwk parameter. 

6.Injecting self-signed JWTs via the jku parameter 

7.
